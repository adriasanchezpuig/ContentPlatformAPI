# IMMFLY backend test

**- Create a Django project to define an API.**<br/>
<br/> The project was created following the steps on this blog: 
<br/> https://medium.com/swlh/build-your-first-rest-api-with-django-rest-framework-e394e39a482c

```bash
$ pip install virtualenv
$ pip install django
$ pip install djangorestframework
```

**- Define models to represent the structure explained above.**<br/>

**- Create a management command to efficiently calculate the ratings of every
channel and export them in a csv file sorted by rating (i.e. the highest rated
channels on top). The csv contains two columns: channel title, average rating.**<br/>
<br/> To run the management command:
  
```bash
  $ python manag.py compute_ratings
```
  
**- Create endpoints to retrieve the channels, their subchannels and its contents.**<br/>
<br/> Endpoints were created following the steps on this blog:
<br/> https://dev.to/jenhsuan/day-23-of-100daysofcode-create-endpoints-with-query-string-on-django-rest-framework-d5o

**- Add unit tests to test the channel rating algorithm.**<br/>
Added unit tests for two methods inside the management command (calculate_channel_means and order_ratings). 
<br/> To execute them run the command:
```bash
  $ python manag.py test
```
The unit tests were created following the steps on this blog:
