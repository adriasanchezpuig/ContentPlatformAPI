- Create a management command to efficiently calculate the ratings of every
channel and export them in a csv file sorted by rating (i.e. the highest rated
channels on top). The csv contains two columns: <channel title>, <average
rating>
To run the management command:
```bash
  $ python manag.py compute_ratings
```
